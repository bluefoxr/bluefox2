So, having explained myself for why I wanted to build a website, I will also explain why I am writing a blog.

The main reason is that, having accumulated quite some experience in various things, particularly indicators and statistics, I often find myself answering questions in emails on recurring topics. Whether or not my answers to these emails are helpful (and I think they are often appreciated), it seems like a good idea to begin to write these things down.

I've noticed that other people who write blogs use these posts as a fast/lazy way to get (hopefully useful) thoughts to other people. More traditional ways are to (a) write a journal paper, or (b) write a book. But in both cases the time and effort is formidable, and most of the time I don't have material to go for either of those options. So, blog posts are here to fill the gap.

The main topics I will cover will be:

* Indicators and composite indicators
* Modelling
* Statistics
* Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis
* Anything else that comes to mind
